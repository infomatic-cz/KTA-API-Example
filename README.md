## Simple example for calling API of Kofax TotalAgility
- Service client is generated by adding service wsdl as Connected services in Visual Studio (this way calls are using SOAP, for detail about REST visit documentation link below)
- Commented code is in [Class1.cs](KTA_REST_API_Example/Class1.cs)
- API documentation for KTA 7.10 https://docshield.kofax.com/KTA/en_US/7.10.0-vmhad0mru4/help/SDK_Documentation/latest/index.html
